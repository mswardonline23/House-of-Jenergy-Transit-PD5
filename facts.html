      <li>An asteroid about the size of a car enters Earth’s atmosphere roughly once a year – but it burns up before it reaches us. Phew!</li>
      <li>The highest mountain known to man is on an asteroid called Vesta. Measuring a whopping 22km in height, it is three times as tall as Mount Everest!</li>  
      <li> If you could fly a plane to Pluto, the trip would take more than 800 years!</li>
